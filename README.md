# Iris Flower Classification

This project is a basic implementation of a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The dataset used is the famous Iris dataset, which is included in the scikit-learn library. This project uses several machine learning models to classify the Iris flowers, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Features
- Loads and preprocesses the Iris dataset
- Visualizes data distributions and correlations
- Trains a classification model using Scikit-learn
- Evaluates model performance

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
